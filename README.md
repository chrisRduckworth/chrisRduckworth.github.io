# Chris Duckworth Portfolio Page

This is the repo for my portfolio page. The live version is available at [chrisrduckworth.github.io](chrisrduckworth.github.io).

In order to make updating my skills and projects easily, they are generated programatically from `projects.json`. The components which do this are `Skills.jsx` and `Project.jsx`. This is the part of the site I'm most pleased with.
