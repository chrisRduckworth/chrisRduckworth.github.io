# Chris Duckworth Portfolio Page

This is the repo for my portfolio page. The live version is available at [chrisrduckworth.github.io](chrisrduckworth.github.io).

In an effort to future proof the site, the skill and project elements are rendered programmatically. This is so when I update it I will only need to update `projects.json`.
